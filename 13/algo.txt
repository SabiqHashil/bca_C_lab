1.start
2.read a word as str
3.set s0 = 0, sn = (length of the str - 1)
4.if s0 < sn then goto step 5, otherwise goto step 8
5.  if str[s0] != str[sn] then goto step 6, otherwise goto step 9.
6.   this string is not palindrome
7.   set s0 = s0 + 1, sn = sn -1; then got to step 5
8.   this srring is a palindrome, if the code reached here that mean the str is palindrome
9. stop
