1.start
2. read the contents of datat file (number) using for each loop and if -1 is entered exit from the foreach loop
3.open Data file in format of read, ODD and EVEN file in format of write using fopen()
4.number = getw(f1)
5.if number != EOF(end of file) then got to step 6, otherwise goto step 7
6. if number % 2 == 0 then write into f3 file otherwise write into f2 file using putw() and goto step 5
7. close the three file using fclose()
8.reopen f2 and f3 in format of read using fopen();
9.printing the contents of f1 and f2 file using while loop
10. set number = getw(f2)-> after f2 then f3 
11. if number != EOF(end of file) then go to step 12, otherwise goto step 13
12. printf(number);
13.stop
