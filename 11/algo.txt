step:
1. start
2. read a range starting number as strnum, range last number as endnum
3. set num = strnum
4. if num <= endnum then go to step 5, other wise go to step 14
5. temp = num, sum = 0
6.   if temp != 0 then go to step 7, other wise go to step 11
7.    r = temp % 10;
8.    temp = temp / 10;
9.    sum = sum + (r * r * r)
10.   if temp != 0 then go to step 6, other wise go to step 11
11. if sum == num then goto step 12, other wise go to step 13
12. num is Armstrong number
13. num++ then goto step 4
14. stop
